## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

Assessability, collaboration, and flexibility. It is available for all operating systems, and easily accessible to most users. You're able to collaborate with a team on the same project, without effecting each others code. It's also very flexible. Like anything in life, projects can change. So it's able to revert back to old versions of the code in an previous branch.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

The ability to have multiple branches allows multiple people to work together on the same master code, without changing the master branch.This allows a group to assign various tasks for the same code. When.working alone, this would allow you to test various things on a finished code, without repercussions.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. It is used to be able to create different branches of code. It stores its data in a local repository, not in a cloud. GitHub is a hosting service for your Git repositories. This allows you to push your local repository into a cloud based one. This in turn makes it easier for multiple people to work on the same project. Not exactly the same, but to me Git is the Notepad, to GitHubs being Google Docs.
