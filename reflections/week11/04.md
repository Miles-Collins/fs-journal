## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

Reflecting back on the course, my experiences have been overwhelmingly positive. I do not have any concerns with my final project, as I have been well taught in class. Fortunately for me time management was drilled into me in the Air Force, and I will attack the project diligently. I have enjoyed working with the teachers, assistants, and classmates. Personally the atmosphere of CodeWorks is overwhelmingly positive.
