## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

The cause of callback hell is when people try to write JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom.

Asynchronous means that things can happen independently of the main program flow.  In this code, you define a function fn , define a function higherOrderFunction that takes a function callback as an argument, and pass fn as a callback to higherOrderFunction .
