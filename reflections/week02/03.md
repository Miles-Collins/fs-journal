## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

The main way to write information to the console is using console.log(). You should use it to evaluate conditional statements, read printed messages or errors, view data from your JavaScript files, and test functions. I personally use them a lot to make sure functions are running properly.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab. This has been useful personally when you want to see how different properties effect the webpage. I can adjust margin, padding, size, colors, without actually effecting my code. I can perfect the results I want first, then go back to my code and change it to that.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

You can write in debugger into your code to break down every event after it. So you can step by step, what is happening, and where something could have went wrong in your code.
