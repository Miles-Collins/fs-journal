# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I think my general understanding of the topic went well.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

I learned that vue makes it a lot easier to do your HTML

- What are you struggling with?

I would still like to be more comfortable with the subject matter. I feel like I understand most of what was taught, but I would like to be able to not use references for as much.

- What would you count as a victory?

Waking up another day!
