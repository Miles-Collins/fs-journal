## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

List in C# is a collection of strongly typed objects. These objects can be easily accessed using their respective index.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
 
Generic list.  The T specifies the type of objects contained in the list, which has the added benefit that the compiler will check and make sure that you only add objects of the correct type to the list - in other words, the List<T> is type-safe.
 
3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

We can use the foreach loop to go through all the items and read them.
