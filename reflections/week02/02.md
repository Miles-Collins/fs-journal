## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

There is a function declaration, a function expression, and an arrow function expression. The function declaration is a generic function, and is hoisted. A function expression defines a named or anonymous function, and is not hoisted. An arrow function expression is a shorter syntax for writing function expressions.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are used when defining a function. They are names created in the function definition. Arguments are values the function receives from each parameter when the function is executed.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

A higher order function is one that accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function. An example is array.protoype.map, or array.prototype.filter.
