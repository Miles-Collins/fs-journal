# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

What went well? I feel like by Wednesday my grasp on the MVC format became well. From there, in-class teaching went well. The MVC as a whole I guess came as a shock. I would say my main struggles come with being able to memorize all the different terms. I couldn't finish the Checkpoint without having the reference a lot. I think the Victory Gunner is a pretty nice victory.
