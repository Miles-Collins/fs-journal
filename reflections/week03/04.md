> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

Problems like ways to update parts of a page in response to certain events. Helps solve one-to-many, one-way, and event-driven data binding. 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

Subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

I honestly don't know. I think the bcw-template is awesome, and is a great way to streamline a specific product. I could see companies using similar tools to ensure certain aspects of their apps, or sites finish with a certain polish.
