## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation is text that accompanies software code to explain what your code is doing, why it's written the way it is, and/or how to use it. There are two main categories of documentation: documentation inside the code and supporting documentation about the code.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

Because it's in plain language and easy to understand, documentation helps junior developers and new team members feel confident jumping into a codebase. This prevents frustration and early abandonment of a task because it gets too complicated too quickly.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Mental Save Points. Documentation is like a mental save point for those times when you finally get what's going on at the end of the day and don't want to lose momentum. Documented code gets reused. Documenting code is part of writing good code. Choosing good names for variables and functions, leaving brief comments within the code to help give context to future readers, and providing API docs, describing each class, method, argument and return value
