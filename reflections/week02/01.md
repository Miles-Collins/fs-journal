## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope is where a variable is available for use. Vars are globally scoped. So if for instance an if statement returned true, and you changed your Var within that if statement. That var will now change to that new variable. A let statement however is used within a block. So if I declare a let statement outside of a block "{}", and then use it again within another block, it will return as an error. CONST are block scoped as well, but a lot more strict globally.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. For instance with a "var", if you were to call on a var that hasn't been defined yet until later in the code. That call on will return as undefined. The "let" variable is hoisted to the top as well. However, unlike "var", it will return a reference error, not undefined. For "const" it is the same. It is hoisted to the top, but not initialized.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

I think in most cases I will be using let over var. Const is great when you don't want a variable to change, and always stay the same. Like a specific type of information. Let for the most part is just a better var, that allows for better use of if, or for loops.
