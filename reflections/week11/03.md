## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database. SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

SQL injections typically fall under three categories: In-band SQLi (Classic), Inferential SQLi (Blind) and Out-of-band SQLi. 

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

Detection methods range from checking server logs to monitoring database errors. Most network intrusion detection systems (IDS) and network perimeter firewalls are not configured to review HTTP traffic for malicious SQL fragments, making it possible for an attacker to bypass network security boundaries.
