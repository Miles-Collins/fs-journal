## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

A Promise is in one of these states: pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully. rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Instead of returning nothing in your function and accepting a callback as an argument, you just wrap the entire content in a promise declaration and resolve/reject instead

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

The main difference between the forms promise. then(success, error) and promise. then(success). catch(error) is that in case if success callback returns a rejected promise, then only the second form is going to catch that rejection
