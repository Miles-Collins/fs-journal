## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One-to-One Relationship. One-to-Many Relationship. Inverse Relationship.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

Think of a relationship as a contract between two tables. When you are building a viz with fields from these tables, Tableau brings in data from these tables using that contract to build a query with the appropriate joins.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

Some of the challenged faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship include things such as knowing when you need to make that relationship. I also think another challenge is managing everything for that relationship.
