## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

It gives you a proper start to your coding. Without direction sometimes you can find yourself working on step 12 of 20, when you should be on step 1 of 20. It also allows to to think and brainstorm how the project should go.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

So far, it depends on what I get stuck on. If it's a bootstrap problem, i'll type in google (my problem here) bs5. That has worked perfectly so far. With css/html same thing as well. I tend to really try to stay within MDN and the main bootstrap for most of my problems. I try to read and understand the answers on their websites.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Plan, but do't over plan. It is ok to make mistakes, and don't be to stubborn not to just search for the answers online. Don't try to "reinvent the wheel" when the wheel will work perfectly fine. Lastly, stay positive through it all. Perseverance is key, and always remember that I can get through it.
