## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

To build a framework that people can reference for ideas. You establish this "blueprint" to help visualize what could be filled within the contents. Also allows for quick tweaks to see what works, and what doesn't.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There are low-fidelity/high-fidelity, mobile-first, and others like ink-on-paper. They are each useful for what you're trying to achieve. A low-fidelity wire-frame would be useful to get the ball rolling for yourself. Whereas you would make a high-fidelity wire-frame to show, or present to more of an audience. Just depending of the context of the situation, you could make a specific wire-frame for that situation.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Absolutely. We have been taught to make a rough draft, blueprints, sketch, or an outline since our childhoods. These are tried and true tools to help direct yourself. Without them, you could find yourself wondering down a path to an unwanted result. I remember personally I use to hate making rough drafts for papers in college. Slowly, very slowly, I began to get the hang of it. Churning out drafts became more fluid, and effortless. As time went on, so did the time it took to write them. The amount of energy it took declined as I refined my skill. I believe 100% effort is important no matter how trivial the project.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I enjoyed making a clone of another website. My takeaway from the project is being mindful of how the website will look on both Mobile, and larger formats. Personally I noticed myself getting tunnel vision at times, and just mashing away at designing the webpage for desktop. Forgetting that my mobile looks like a mashed up hotdog.
