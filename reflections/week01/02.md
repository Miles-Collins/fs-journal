## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a state of teh selected elements. Looking over some of the ones listed on MDN :hover, :root, :invalid, :required, :checked, :valid.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is essentially the order of operations of which rule will be applied. There's no addition or subtraction, but instead it just takes the highest value and rolls with it. You can use it to your benefit to assign different values, without having to worry about different code that might already be on it. Even if another value is on it, if your use a higher specificity, it will override it.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

I think one of the main problems would be time consumption, and it would be hard to read if you didn't work on it. It would take substantially longer if you have to !important each value that you want. I feel like it would be better practice to just make a new class to define what you actually want. Also if you didn't work on it, going through through the code could be more time consuming.
