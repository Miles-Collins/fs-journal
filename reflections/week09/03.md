## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Base64 is an encoding algorithm that converts any characters, binary data, and even images or sound files into a readable string, which can be saved or transported over the network without data loss. The characters generated from Base64 encoding consist of Latin letters, digits, plus, and slash.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

The only downside is that base64 encoding will require around 33% more space than regular strings. So with base64 you can encode and transfer any sets of binary data through any system and then decode them to original binary data.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

It allows the images to be loaded up faster, and more efficiently.
