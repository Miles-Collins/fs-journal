# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I felt like I was able to absorb a lot from the class teachings. I think from starting Tuesday, to how I finished Friday my understanding of JavaScript increased exponentially. I enjoyed making the different afternoon projects.

I don't think anything shocked or surprised me.

Right now I don't think i'm struggling with anything. I did have a slight trouble at first with the difference between drawing from and array, and a dictionary, but I was able to figure it out.

I felt like the whole week was a victory. If anything I feel like I can go back and make the Ice cream parlor project a lot better, in just the 2 extra days of schooling.
