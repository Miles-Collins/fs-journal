## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is used to assure the value in the particular column is unique. The foreign key provides the link between the two tables.


2. What is an `Alias`?

Namespaces in C# serve two main purposes: to organize classes and functionality and to control the scope of classes and methods.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorsId VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorsId VARCHAR(255) NOT Null,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
  
  FOREIGN KEY (doctorsId) REFERENCES doctors(doctorId)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT
p.*,
d.*,
FROM patients p
JOIN doctors d ON d.doctorsId = p.doctorsId

```
