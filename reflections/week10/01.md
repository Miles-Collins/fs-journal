## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value Types. Directly stores the value of a variable in memory. Accepts both signed and unsigned literals. ...
Reference Types. They store the address of variable i.e. they contain the reference to a variable. ...
Pointer Types. They contain the memory address of the variable.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null. We refer to these as primitive data types. A single variable can only store a single type of data.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

A Value Type holds the data within its own memory allocation and a Reference Type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the real data. Reference Type variables are stored in the heap while Value Type variables are stored in the stack.
