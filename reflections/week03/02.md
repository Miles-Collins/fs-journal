## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Prevents access to the variables by adding public entities inside an object

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

They didn't include a mechanism for private properties. There was no way to create a private property for an object in JavaScript

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

We create private variables by keeping them out of the class. I would do this to keep the user from being able to make changes to that variable, function, or anything else that I wouldn't want them to fiddle around with.
