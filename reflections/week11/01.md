## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

In C#, inheritance allows us to create a new class from an existing class.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

The derived class inherits the fields and methods of the base class. This helps with the code reusability in C#. The class which inherits the base class has all members of a base class as well as can also have some additional properties.

 A derived class accesses inherited members based on the access specifier inherited from the parent class.
