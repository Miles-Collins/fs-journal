## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can add a new value to a column of data type enum using ALTER MODIFY command. If you want the existing value of enum, then you need to manually write the existing enum value at the time of adding a new value to column of data type enum.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have not used enums in any afternoon project that i'm aware of. The closest thing I can think of would be the use of dates and stuff. A common example of enums is a compass, so maybe that way.
