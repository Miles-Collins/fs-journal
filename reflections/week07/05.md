# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I felt like I had a very solid week. My understanding of Vue, and Node has definitely increased.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

Nothing that was shocking or surprising. Felt like this was just a review week.

- What are you struggling with?

Still making sure I stay on track, and try not to style to much before I get everything on the page.

- What would you count as a victory?

Life is a victory!
