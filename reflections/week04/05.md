# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I feel my positive attitude, and drive to learn everyday.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

This week we learned primarily the async principles of Get, Post, Put, Delete. Didn't seem
to difficult in class, but in practice more thought into it.

- What are you struggling with?

I wish when I did my assignments I was more fluid, and consistent. 

- What would you count as a victory?

Finishing the week with another 100%.
