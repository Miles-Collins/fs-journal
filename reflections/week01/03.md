## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Honestly all of them were great tips that I will use in my future. I am huge on design, and enjoy that aspect very much. Some of the tips to make a simple, but elegant layout speaks to me.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

The website listed Dribbble had some good examples of different layouts. I did some research and websites like Siteinspire and Awwards will probably be saved to the booksmarks. I am always referencing the bootstrap website as well.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

The way you market yourself, and present yourself is often the most important aspect of your product. Apple for example grew a huge niche audience with their Iphones, and Mac books, even though there are (easily) arguably better products out there. In spite of that their design and simplistic look of their websites hooked people in. Websites and web design works the same. If you're are selling fluffy stuffed animals, your website should be inviting and playful, not a dark and cluttered.
